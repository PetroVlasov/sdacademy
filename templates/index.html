      <hr>
      <h3>Course Program</h3>
      <h4>This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python. The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Informatics”. This course is equivalent to the first half of the 11-week "Programming for Everybody (Python)" course. Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses.</h4>
      <h3>Why Python is so good</h3>
      <h4>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as  other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</h4>

      <ul class="a">
        <li>Python is Interpreted: Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>

        <li>Python is Interactive: You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>

        <li>Python is Object-Oriented: Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>

        <li>Python is a Beginner's Language: Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
      </ul>

          <h3>Cute Wabbit Joke</h3>
          <p><em>A little girl goes into a pet show and asks for a wabbit. The shop keeper looks down at her, smiles and says:</em></p>
          <p><em>"Would you like a lovely fluffy little white rabbit, or a cutesy wootesly little brown rabbit?"</em></p>
          <p><em>"Actually", says the little girl, "I don't think my python would notice."</em></p>
